## Voxel Magica
Voxelâ˜…Magica is a highly WIP minecraft mod that (as you might be able to tell from the name) is loosly based on the Madoka Magica series.
Many of the spells were inspired by mechanics found in the MMO Final Fantasy 14.
There isn't a version that I feel is complete enhough for release, but I guess you could download and compile the source to mess around with what is functional.

Shoutout to McJty and TheGreyGhost for creating tutorials that greatly helped the development of this mod!
